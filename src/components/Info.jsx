    The founders of this webpage are avid volunteers who have first-hand experience on the scarcity of helping hands in the volunteering scene. Furthermore, there has been many occurrences of citizens who are keen in doing a part for society but are unsure of where to start. Hence, our mission is to provide a bridging platform for volunteer organizations to reach out to the public and create an accessible webpage where interested volunteers have a place to begin their volunteering journey.  

    For organizations:
    All you have to do is to post a short scope of the volunteering activity and the number of pax you would ideally need. After that, you just have to wait for potential helpers!
    
    For volunteers:
    Just look out for the alerts and apply for the ones that youâ€™re interested in. Our webpage will sort the offers based on your proximity to the locations to provide you the best convenience.
